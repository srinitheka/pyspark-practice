    "# **Question 26: What are some best practices for tuning Spark applications for optimal performance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuning Spark applications for optimal performance is essential to make the most of your cluster's resources. Here are some best practices for achieving this and an example code sample for each practice:\n",
    "# 🔹Memory Management:\n",
    "# Optimize memory allocation: Set the appropriate memory configurations, such as spark.driver.memory, spark.executor.memory, and spark.memory.fraction, to efficiently use available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n",
    "\n",
    "# spark = SparkSession.builder \\\n",
    "#  .appName(\"MemoryManagementExample\") \\\n",
    "#  .config(\"spark.driver.memory\", \"2g\") \\\n",
    "#  .config(\"spark.executor.memory\", \"4g\") \\\n",
    "#  .getOrCreate()\n",
    "\n",
    "# spark.stop()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Data Serialization:\n",
    "# Choose efficient serialization: Use a more efficient serialization format like Avro or Parquet, which can reduce the amount of data transfer and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# spark.conf.set(\"spark.serializer\", \"org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\")\n",
    "# spark.conf.set(\"spark.kryo.registrator\", \"your.package.YourKryoRegistrator\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Data Partitioning:\n",
    "# Optimize data partitioning: Repartition your data using repartition or coalesce to balance data distribution and avoid data skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "# df = df.repartition(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Caching and Persistence:\n",
    "# Cache and persist data: Use cache() or persist() to store frequently used data in memory for faster access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# df = df.cache()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Shuffling Optimization:\n",
    "# Minimize shuffling: Avoid unnecessary shuffling by using operations like reduceByKey instead of groupByKey.\n",
    "\n",
    "# rdd.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Broadcasting:\n",
    "# Broadcast small data: Broadcast small DataFrames to all nodes to avoid unnecessary data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# broadcast_small_df = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(small_df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Optimized Joins:\n",
    "# Use optimized join strategies: Utilize broadcast join, bucketed join, or sort-merge join based on your data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# joined_df = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), \"id\", \"inner\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Dynamic Resource Allocation:\n",
    "# Enable dynamic allocation: Allow Spark to allocate and release resources dynamically based on the workload.\n",
    "# spark.conf.set(\"spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled\", \"true\")"

    "# Apache Spark has a distributed and modular internal architecture that allows it to efficiently process large volumes of data. Below, I'll provide an overview of Spark's internal architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Driver Program:**\n",
    "#  - The Driver Program is the entry point of any Spark application. It runs the `main()` function and creates a SparkSession or SparkContext, which is used to coordinate the execution of Spark tasks.\n",
    "#  - The Driver Program is responsible for dividing the application into tasks, scheduling these tasks on the cluster, and managing their execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Cluster Manager:**\n",
    "#  - Spark can run on various cluster managers, including Apache Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, and its standalone cluster manager.\n",
    "#  - The cluster manager allocates resources (CPU and memory) to Spark applications and monitors their progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Cluster Nodes (Executors):**\n",
    "#  - Executors are worker nodes in the Spark cluster where the actual computation takes place.\n",
    "#  - Each executor runs tasks in separate JVM processes. Executors communicate with the Driver Program and with each other for data shuffling and task coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Task:**\n",
    "#  - A task is the smallest unit of work in Spark and represents a computation to be executed on a single partition of data.\n",
    "#  - Tasks are spawned by the Driver Program and run on the Executors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Distributed Data Storage:**\n",
    "#  - Spark can use distributed data storage systems like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Apache HBase to store and access data.\n",
    "#  - Data is divided into partitions and distributed across the cluster, enabling parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD):**\n",
    "#  - RDD is Spark's fundamental data structure. It represents distributed collections of data that can be processed in parallel.\n",
    "#  - RDDs are immutable and fault-tolerant, meaning they can recover from node failures by recomputing lost data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):**\n",
    "#  - Spark uses a DAG to represent a logical execution plan of tasks and transformations.\n",
    "#  - Each stage in the DAG corresponds to a set of transformations that can be executed in parallel.\n",
    "#  - The DAG scheduler optimizes the execution plan and schedules tasks based on data dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. **Transformations and Actions:**\n",
    "#  - Transformations are operations applied to RDDs to create new RDDs (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduceByKey`).\n",
    "#  - Actions are operations that trigger the execution of transformations and return results (e.g., `collect`, `count`, `saveAsTextFile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. **Shuffling:**\n",
    "#  - Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across partitions or nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "#  - It's a costly operation and can impact performance, so minimizing shuffling is important for Spark optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. **Caching:**\n",
    "#  - Spark allows you to cache (persist) RDDs or DataFrames in memory, improving performance for iterative algorithms and interactive data analysis.\n",

But sometimes we also need to tune the configuration parameters for performance and so it should not be a black box for us. \n",

    "# - YARN Application Manager is responsible for negotiating resources with Resource manager. Set aside one executor in the cluster for that.\n",

    "# 1. Fat Executors: 16 cores per executor, number of executor per node=1, executor-memory=64/1=64GB, total number of executors=1*10=10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problems: 1. HDFS throughput suffers because of a lot concurrent threading 2. Garbage Collection takes a lot time since memory per executor is very high\n",
    "\n",
    "# Balanced Approach: Let's take 5 cores per executors. Why 5? Because beyond 5 HDFS throughput will suffer and we get good multithreading also.\n",
    "# Leave 1 core per node for daemon processes, Number of cores available per node =16-1=15\n",
    "# Total number of available cores=15*10=150\n",
    "# Number of executors=150/5=30\n",
    "# Leave 1 executor for AM, num-executors=30-1=29\n",
